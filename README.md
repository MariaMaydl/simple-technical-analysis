# Simple Technical Analysis for SP500 with Python

Hello everyone! 

This is my take on the Python for Finance Cookbook (2. ed.) technical analysis from Eryk Lewinson in Streamlit.
I added also a help section, which runs with the OpenAI model "text-davinci-003" and added new technical analysis features.

There is definitely room for improvement. If you have any suggestions, just let me know ðŸ˜„ 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What can you do with it?

* View the stock prices for every company in the SP500 index
* Select and download the data as csv-file
* Select different technical analysis metrics with different parameters
* Ask questions in the help section

**Important**: This should definitley be clear, but you should not use this tool to buy or sell stocks.
